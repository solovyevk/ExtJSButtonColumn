A Ext.grid.column.Column subclass which renders a button like background in each column cell. It offers a scoped click handler
for it. You can make it like a Split Button with a dropdown menu to execute multiple actions. The dropdown can be configured
like a Ext.grid.column.Action with "items" array config option or generated at runtime with "setupMenu" method. Options provided
for styling, enabling/disabling button and it's menu items. This is was tested on 4.0 and 4.1. I'm working to port it to 4.2
