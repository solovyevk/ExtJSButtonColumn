I found that with buffering of mouseover and mouseout event handling on view items in Ext.view.View, 
we losing "mouseout" event. It almost never get propogated down to the grid, only "mouseover":

Here I just log event type at the beginning of  Ext.view.View.handleMouseOverOrOut method  src/view/View.js:480 
as I move mouse accros grid view items

1) Buffering - the default set with mouseOverOutBuffer for 20 milliseconds. The 'mouseout' event lost

Ext.view.View.handleMouseOverOrOut - process event: mouseover
Ext.view.View.handleMouseOverOrOut - process event: mouseover
Ext.view.View.handleMouseOverOrOut - process event: mouseover
Ext.view.View.handleMouseOverOrOut - process event: mouseover
Ext.view.View.handleMouseOverOrOut - process event: mouseover

2) No buffering - the mouseOverOutBuffer set to false. The 'mouseout' events propogated fine : . 


Ext.view.View.handleMouseOverOrOut - process event: mouseover
Ext.view.View.handleMouseOverOrOut - process event: mouseout
Ext.view.View.handleMouseOverOrOut - process event: mouseover
Ext.view.View.handleMouseOverOrOut - process event: mouseout
Ext.view.View.handleMouseOverOrOut - process event: mouseover
Ext.view.View.handleMouseOverOrOut - process event: mouseout

Since Ext.ux.ButtonColumn blue highlight logic is driven by "mouseover" and"mouseout" events 
we need to turn off buffer of mouseover and mouseout event o support it. It is done in grid config like this:

viewConfig: {
  mouseOverOutBuffer:false
}

I also had to reset "Ext.view.View" mouseOverItem flag - this is the only way
to make mouseover && mouseout events fired correctly on grid cell. Otherwise just 'mouseout' get fired then we enter the cell, no events fired if move mouse inside grid cell
